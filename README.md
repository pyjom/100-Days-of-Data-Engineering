# 100-Days-of-Data-Engineering
Hello everyone, I am John Jomari Arubio and this is my 100-day journey to learn and upskill myself in the exciting world of data engineering. This repository will serve as a central hub for documenting my progress, learnings, and projects throughout this period.

Let's go!

**Project Structure:**

* **Day-** (folders): Each folder represents a specific day of the 100-day challenge. They might contain:
    * Notes and learnings from courses or resources.
    * Code for completed projects or exercises (leetcode).
    * Additional resources or research materials.
* **resources.md:** This file lists the online courses, tutorials, and books I'm using for my learning journey.



**Stay Connected!**

I'm always open to feedback and learning from others. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!

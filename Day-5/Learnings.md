## Day 5

I continued and finished the 5-hour video of Linux and Command Terminals from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtqBQ68cfJc). The remanining talks about the common command used when collaborating, the used of sudo, different users, understanding permissions etc.

I revisited my Python and took some refresher course from Kuya [Josh Valdeleon](https://www.youtube.com/@joshvaldeleon3138). Its actually fun relearning the fundamentals of Python, and it makes me excited to visit some old stuff and learn the little things I left. Good example is the common mistakes in naming class and function and many more.

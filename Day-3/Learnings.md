## Day 3

It's a new day to continue the 100 Day Challenge! Today, I finished the Advance topic in SQL where it talks about Common Table Expression (CTE), Temporary Tables, Commonly used String Functions, Stored Procedures and the usage of Subqueries.

To enhance my SQL skills I also answered leetcode problems about JOIN and continue their SQL 50 program. Unlike yesterday, the problems now are getting more challenging and complex. They tagged it as easy but they gotta be kidding because most of the problems in JOIN are not easy at all! But I am up for the challenge baby :>


### Important note
I included in this folder the SQL codes I used in learning Advance SQL. I am using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

### Important takeaways
* You cannot select all column when dealing with Subquery in WHERE
* It's better to use CTE or Temp. Table than Subquery in FROM. 
* Beware in using Fuzzy Matching, always double or triple check it!

## Day 2

Today I dedicated my time into learning the basic and intermediate topics in SQL. As a Data Engineer, we are expected to perfrom:
* Extraction of data from databases for analysis or further processing.
* Transformation of data by filtering, aggregating, and joining tables.
* Loading data into databases or data warehouses.
* Querying databases to retrieve specific information or generate reports for data consumers. 

I am also continuosly reading [Fundametals of Data Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Engineering-Robust-Systems/dp/1098108302) by Joe Reis and Matt Housley, where I am now at Chapter 5: Data Generation, here I am learning about of APIs and Data Sharing.

Today, I also started answering problems in leetcode, particularly the SQL 50, and finished the problems about SELECT

### Important note
I included in this folder the SQL codes I used in learning Basic and Intermediate of SQL. I am using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

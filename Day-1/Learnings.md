## Day 1

Today I go back and relearn git and github. As a future data engineer, it is very important to understand the fundamentals and concept of git as version control. 
* Git can track my progress and my code over time, it is also good tool for me to keep track on how I write code and to reflect on it and take what is good and remove what is bad. 
* Git is good with collaboration. In my future work, I would be collaborating with other engineers and designers. Learning and using git will give me advantage and ready me for the future job.

I am also continuosly reading [Fundametals of Data Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Engineering-Robust-Systems/dp/1098108302) by Joe Reis and Matt Housley, where I am now at Chapter 5: Data Generation, here I am learning about Source Systems, Major Ideas in Database and Types of Database.

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is the most common pattern in storing appplication state in database.

### Important note
* Commit early, commit often
* Working Directory -> Staging Area --> Commit History

### Important things I learn
* How to create a local repository and connect it to a remote repository 
* How to merge two branches
* How to delete, how to create tag, version and branching
